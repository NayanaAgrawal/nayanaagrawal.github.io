      <p>I started this project in September, 2017. My goal was to create a compilation of stories for young children in
        our local community in Jakarta, Indonesia. I wanted to produce something which would be educational and still enjoyable,
        which is why I decided to make the book bilingual. It provided the children opportunities to learn English as well as
        read in the local language, Bahasa Indonesia.</p>

      <p>The first stage was to select group members to help me with the project. I selected people who were punctual,
        responsible, and would be passionate about the project because it was volunteer-based and required a high amount of
        effort. The people on the team were divided into three categories: writers, illustrators, and translators.</p>

      <p>We collaborated to put together drafts of the story. I was responsible for creating deadlines, providing file sizes
        and other guidelines, and writing one of the stories within the book. After we compiled all the material, I assembled
        the project into a legible book. I made the book cover by making a mosaic of all the art styles within, and a table
        of contents to organize the text better. </p>

      <p>One of my goals since the start of the project was to distribute the final product for free to surrounding
        communities and libraries that were in need of new material. Because of the size of the project and the cost of
        printing multiple copies in colour, we requested funding from the PTA. After our presentation, we were given more
        funds than we applied for because the board members approved highly of the idea and wanted us to publish a book of
        the best possible quality.</p>

      <p>I contacted a local publishing agency, pitched our project, and agreed on a cost. Throughout the next few weeks, we
        discussed paper quality, ink costs, binding methods, and other details involved in publishing a book.</p>

      <p>At the end of the project, we were able to print and distribute 60 copies of the book to the local community. I
        learned many valuable skills through this experience. Managing a project with so many moving components was challenging
        and taught me the importance of planning ahead, setting deadlines, and co-ordinating efforts between the teams. I also
        learned that the process doesnâ€™t end after you put the pages in order and make a pretty cover. There are many nuances
        one must consider when aiming to mass-produce a book at this scale. These are just a couple of the lessons I took
        away from my memorable experience, and I would definitely consider a similar project with more sophistication in the
        future.</p>
