      <h2>SHORT STORY -- Departure</h2>
      <h3>June 2019</h3>
      <div class="stories">
        <p> The sound of my heart echoes in my ears in a steady thump. I fidget in my car seat every few seconds, and crack my
          knuckles to make them click. We speed down the highway, deserted because of the late hour.</p>
        <p> “Will you stop that? And sit still! We’re almost there, now.” Mama chides.</p>
        <p>“Okay, okay, you know I’m just excited!” </p>
        <p>“Are you really so eager to leave home? You don’t look sad at all.” </p>
        <p>“No, it’s not that, I’m just excited for university!” </p>
        <p>Mama doesn’t look placated by my explanation. I sigh and lean back in my seat. I know that she will miss me, and
          I know I’ll be homesick when I get there, too. But right now, all I can think about is being at university, living
          in a dorm, and exploring Toronto. </p>
        <p> As we approach the airport, glimpses of my childhood flood my brain.</p>
        <p>I remember seeing the bold lettered name printed on a large sign: “Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Mumbai.”  </p>
        <p> I remember crying uncontrollably, hugging my childhood friends who came with me for a last goodbye before I transferred to Egypt.</p>
        <p> I remember promising them that we would write letters to each other, that we would do our homework together over video call, and that I would come and visit them every summer. </p>
        <p>Of course, none of our promises came true. The bittersweet memory makes a deep wave of nostalgia swell within me.</p>
        <p>An elderly police officer with a kind smile checks my tickets and my papers at the entrance to the airport. “Another kid off to university, huh? Good luck, little girl! Make your parent proud! You traveling alone?” </p>
        <p>“Yes, it’s just me. Thank you very much!” I smile at him. </p>
        <p> I hug my parents. They smile at me, and wish me luck.</p>
        <p> “Call us when you get to New York for your transit flight.”</p>
        <p> “Let us know if you have any difficulty at the airport.”</p>
        <p> “Oh, and we’ll wait here in the parking lot until you finish checking in.”</p>
        <p>“You don’t have to do that,” I say, checking my phone. “It’s late, you should head home.” </p>
        <p> “Don’t worry,” he smiles at me. “We won’t see you again for months, it’s the least we can do.” </p>
        <p>Unbidden tears rise to the surface blur my sight. A sudden realization settles over my heart. I won’t see Mama or Papa again for months, no matter how much I want to. I hug them tightly again, trying to stifle my emotion. I even hug my little brother, making him whine in protest. I can see him hide his sadness behind his attitude, and I ruffle his hair. I’m going to miss him. The thought surprises me, considering I normally find his presence irritating.  </p>
        <p> “Hey, hey, don’t be sad, little girl!” says the friendly security officer. I suppose he sees a lot of crying teenagers on the airport around this time of year. “You don’t want to worry your parents, do you?” I shake my head, rubbing my eyes. I can see tears welling in Mama’s eyes, too. I paste a watery smile on my face for my parents, so they aren’t too worried about me.</p>
        <p> I turn around, dragging my suitcases through the airport gates.</p>
        <p>The smile fades off my face as I approach my check-in counter.  </p>
