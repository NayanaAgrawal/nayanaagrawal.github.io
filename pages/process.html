					<h1>HOW IT WAS DONE</h1>

						<p>My goal for this website was to include a lot of colours and visual imagery. I wanted it to be a representative of my likes and design choices, so instead of choosing one theme colour, I decided to use a different one for each page. I also used a lot of nature imagery for the cards and jumbotron images of my site. This was another way to maintain consistency, even though the colours and elements on each page were so different. I didn’t want things to get too busy or chaotic, so I stuck with different tones of the same colour for each page. To keep them from clashing on the Home page, I used grayscale wherever possible. I also used each page’s theme colour for the various highlight segments of the page to follow the principles of disclosure and exemplars not only semantically, but also visually. Outside of the color palette, I made sure to keep the design consistent by choosing similar font weights, fonts, and sizes and using a similar style for buttons and tooltips.</p>

						<p>Even though I kept a consistent design, I also wanted to make each page stand out. I did this by changing up the type of jumbotron image by using fade effects, videos, or leaving the jumbotron entirely. I also organized information on each page differently so they all looked unique. I also made each page different by including different interactive components. For example, I used a carousel on the Home page, an image grid with caption overlays on the Gallery page, and an embedded video on the Contact page. This added some variety to the content on the website to differentiate the pages and avoid recycling the same code multiple times.</p>
						
						<p>I kept accessibility in mind throughout the coding and designing process for my website. I paid special attention to colour contrasts because of how many colours and image overlays I was using. I ran each page through WAVE to catch any missing alt tags, low colour contrasts, empty links, and other issues related to accessibility. I wanted to make sure that even if someone was browsing through the website without being able to see all the visuals, they would have a good idea of what content was on each individual page.</p>
						
						<p>Overall, I found the coding process a lot easier using Bootstrap. For assignment 1, I spent a long time trying to manage my floating elements, making sure everything was balanced, and trying to align content. However, using the rows and columns system, I already had the foundation with containers and could focus more about designing the content itself. It gave me a lot of flexibility with being able to make design decisions I couldn’t make in assignment 1 because of how easy it was to use the Bootstrap portfolio template.</p>
