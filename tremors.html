      <h2>SHORT STORY -- TREMORS</h2>
      <h3>March 2019</h3>
      <div class="stories">
        <p>Crap!” I exclaim when I lose again.</p>
        <p>“Oh, what a shame. Maybe you’ll get it next time,” my friend Will grins mockingly. I bounce my leg, sending jitters through my body. I’ll definitely win the next game, just you wait. I take a deep breath, pick up my new hand of cards, and plan my strategy to win.</p>
        <p>The study room’s door creaks open. We turn around to see who’s coming. The boy walking in through the door has scuffed shoes, rumpled clothing, dishevelled hair, and bloodshot eyes. I squint. I’m sure that I’ve met him before, but I can’t remember his name.</p>
        <p>“Hey, Michael,” Will greets. Ah, right, Michael. He nods in greeting, shuffling in and dropping into a chair with a groan. I peek at him from the corner of my eye. Isn’t he supposed to be in his Politics class right now? Instead, he’s slumped down in his chair. His head is in his arms, and he breathes deeply as if he’s asleep. I return my gaze to my cards, relieved that I won’t have to make small talk.</p>
        <p>“Are you ready to lose again?” Will goads.</p>
        <p>“You are on, mate. Watch me wreck you this time.”</p>
        <p>“You said that last game, too. Aren’t you losing?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, you little--”</p>
        <p>Michael lifts his head and mumbles “Is it just me, or are we shaking?”</p>
        <p>I blink. His interruption derails me from my anger. I force my leg to stop bouncing, wondering if I was shaking the table. Just as I’m about to tell Michael that he was imagining it, a small tremor runs through my chair. I glance around and notice that the glass walls of the study room are trembling, too.</p>
        <p>“Earthquake, I think,” Will says. He pushes his chair back to stand up.</p>
        <p>“Oh, shit!” I know I should be afraid, or at least concerned, but for the first time in my three years in Jakarta, an earthquake has had enough force that I can physically feel it. Smaller ones are almost a mundane occurrence.</p>
        <p>As I leave the study room, classroom doors along the hallway burst open. A flood of chattering, unfazed students stream towards the tennis court. My school has enough earthquake drills and information sessions every month that we all know what to do.</p>
        <p>Nobody rushes forward, raises their voice, or panics. The floor trembles beneath us. I slow down, trying to keep my balance. The chaotic commotion of clinking glass and clattering metal follows me through the building. I hear a deep, subtle rumbling, just quiet enough that it feels like it’s resonating inside my head.</p>
        <p>We march towards the tennis court in orderly lines, where teachers will take attendance to make sure everyone has successfully evacuated the buildings. I hear passing conversation as I weave through the crowd.</p>
        <p>“How long do you think this is gonna last, Vi?”</p>
        <p>“Dude, I have no idea. Maybe they’ll cancel Spanish!”</p>
        <p>The lines crawl forward. Our journey feels neverending, even though the court stands only a minute away from the main building. Wait, where’d Michael go? I scan the crowd to make sure he safely left the building. I catch him with some friends from his Politics class, whispering. He furrows his brows and pulls his lips down into a frown.</p>
        <p>His concern makes me guilty, as if I should be worried, too. But all I feel right now is curiosity about what will happen next, and irritation at my card game being interrupted.</p>
        <p>Will and I part ways to join our respective teachers. I sigh and sneak my phone out of my pocket, even though we aren’t supposed to bring anything with us when there’s an evacuation. Every few minutes, a notification from Snapchat lights up my phone. My friends post pictures of different parts of the tennis court with some variation of the word “earthquake”
            in the caption. We all go to the same school, it’s not like I can’t tell there’s an earthquake happening.</p>
        <p>Our wait lasts an eternity, even though my phone proclaims only eighteen minutes have passed. We wait for the aftershocks to fade so that it’s safe to return to the buildings.</p>
        <p>The earth’s grumbling is muffled by the pleasant chatter echoing around the tennis court. Once my teacher looks away, I scoot to the left, coughing until I catch Will’s attention. We sneak out of our groups to sit together.</p>
        <p>“I know this is supposed to be a serious natural disaster,” I start, “but I just…”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, I know what you mean,” he admits. His sheepish grin affirms my own lack of guilt, making me feel better. “I wish we brought the cards here.”</p>
